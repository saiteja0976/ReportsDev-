7Q)
Yes, the argument given about is true.We can increase the sales of any business by advertising the business in a platform such that the effect of impact on the business on targeted people must be high.

For example if we consider any boost it targets the childs so they advertise it mainly in TV because childs spend a lot of time on TV and they advertise in non school hours only because during the school hours the targeted people will be less.

But sometimes the same advertising may bring the business down.Because sometimes one feel like if one is advertising it for too much they think that  they might be running low on business and trying to increase their sales.Because if ones company is getting goof profits their is no need of advertising in the first point.
